		Foundation Problems in Panama City Beach, Destin and 30a Areas
	</h2>
	<p class="w-3/4 mx-auto mt-8 text-lg lg:text-xl">
		The sandy soil in Northwest Florida can make homes susceptible to foundation problems. These
		problems can be caused by a number of factors, including:
	</p>
	<div class="w-3/4 mx-auto mt-8 text-lg lg:text-xl">
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Weather:</strong> Heavy rains and flooding can put a lot of stress on foundations.
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				<strong>Age:</strong> Older homes are more likely to have foundation problems.
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				<strong>Poor construction:</strong> Homes that were not built properly are more likely to have
				foundation problems.
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				<strong>Poor compaction:</strong> Homes that were built on poorly compacted soil can settle over
				time, causing foundation issues.
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				<strong>Organic material underground:</strong> Many homes and neighborhoods were built on land
				that was cleared. After clearing the land, the contractor may have buried organic material such
				as trees. Over time, the organic material breaks down underground, causing the soil around it
				to settle - potentially taking your homeâ€™s foundation with it.
			</li>
