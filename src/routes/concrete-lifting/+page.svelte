<h1>Concrete Lifting</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		Concrete lifting is a process of raising sunken concrete slabs back to their original level.
		This can be done using a variety of methods, including mudjacking, polyurethane foam injection,
		and helical piers. Concrete lifting is a cost-effective way to repair damaged concrete and can
		extend the life of your driveway, patio, or walkway.

	<h2>Benefits of Concrete Lifting</h2>
	<p>There are many benefits to concrete lifting, including:</p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Cost-effective: Concrete lifting is a more affordable option than replacing damaged
				concrete.
			</li>
			<li>
				Quick and easy: Concrete lifting can be completed in a single day or perhaps two, without
				the need for demolition or major disruption. When compared with tearing out and repouring
				concrete which can take weeks or longer, destroy your yard and landscaping, and prevent use
				of driveway for long periods of time, there is no comparison to the convenience of
				polyurethane foam injections for concrete lifting.
			</li>
			<li>
				Durable: Concrete lifting is a permanent solution that will not require further repairs.
			</li>
			<li>
				Efficient: Concrete lifting uses less material than other methods, such as mudjacking, which
				can save you money.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Types of Concrete Lifting</h2>
	<p>Real foundation experts recommend two main types of concrete lifting:</p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Polyurethane foam injection: Polyurethane foam injection is a newer, more efficient method
				of concrete lifting. It involves drilling holes in the concrete and injecting a polyurethane
				foam under the slab. The foam expands and raises the slab to its original level. It is
				closed-cell (impermeable to water) and extremely strong, capable of lifting heavy loads of
				thousands of pounds.
			</li>
			<li>
				Helical piers: Helical piers are a permanent solution for concrete lifting. They are
				installed under the concrete slab and extend down to stable soil. The piers support the slab
				and prevent it from sinking further. Depending on the application, we also recommend push
				piers and slab piers.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
		Another common method of concrete lifting is called mudjacking. It involves drilling holes in
		the concrete and injecting a mixture of soil, sand, and water under the slab. The mixture
		expands and raises the slab to its original level. We do not recommend this type of repair.
		Closed-cell, structural polyurethane foam injection has far surpassed this outdated technology.

	<h2>Choosing the Right Concrete Lifting Method</h2>
	<p>
		The best method of concrete lifting for you will depend on the size and severity of the problem.
		If the concrete is only slightly sunken, mudjacking may be a sufficient solution. However, if
		the concrete is severely sunken or cracked, polyurethane foam injection or helical piers may be
		a better option.

	<h2>Cost of Concrete Lifting</h2>
	<p>
		The cost of concrete lifting will vary depending on the size of the area to be repaired, the
		method used, and the cost of materials. In general, concrete lifting is a cost-effective
		solution for repairing damaged concrete.
