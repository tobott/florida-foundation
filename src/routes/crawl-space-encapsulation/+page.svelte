		How to Encapsulate a Crawl Space?
	</h2>
	<p class="w-3/4 mx-auto mt-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">
		While some very advanced and diligent homeowners have been able to perform a modest
		encapsulation as a DIY project, you should know that this type of work is not for the faint of
		heart. It involves working in very confined, moist, potentially filthy spaces, digging in
		confined spaces, dealing with darkness, pests such as spiders and spider webs, cockroaches,
		mice, cave crickets, etc.
	</p>
	<p class="w-3/4 mx-auto mt-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">
		If the crawl space is wet, you are crawling through mud and breathing air that is filled with
		mold and mildew spores. Oftentimes the moisture has caused the insulation to be completely
		saturated and filled with mold and mildew. To remove this material is extremely dirty and
		difficult work that may involve coming into direct contact with fiberglass insulation. It is
		imperative to use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as coveralls, gloves, goggles,
		and a high quality respirator.
	</p>
	<p class="w-3/4 mx-auto mt-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">
		Breathing the air in a crawl space can be extremely dangerous for anyone, but especially for
		those with allergies or respiratory problems and can lead to illness. To do the job properly
		will also involve removing and carrying out soil, mud and debris that is excavated, which often
		entails a process such as shoving the dirt into 5-gallon buckets and crawling/dragging it out.
		You will also need to crawl/drag heavy materials such as gravel, sump pumps, and a dehumidifier
		into the space. A professional will have the experience and knowledge to do the work safely to
		properly seal your crawl space and prevent moisture from building up.

							To control ground water and bulk stormwater runoff, we install a sump pit lined with

							minute. The system works with a float switch, so when groundwater or bulk stormwater
							runoff threatens your crawl space, it will channel to the sump pit. As the water
							rises, the float switch kicks the pump into action and it will eject the water through
							a ¼” PVC pipe to a discharge location away from your foundation where it can run away
							and percolate into the ground or a stormwater system.

				Cost of Crawl Space Encapsulation
			</h2>
			<p class="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">
				The cost of crawl space encapsulation varies depending on the size of your crawl space and
				the materials that are used. We find smaller homes can be properly encapsulated for around
				$15,000 with medium sized homes being in the $20,000 range and larger homes being upwards of
				$30,000. Savvy homeowners realize the benefits and view this expense as an investment in
				their home and the health of their family.
