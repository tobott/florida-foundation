		Are you experiencing foundation problems in your Panama City area home?
	</h2>
	<p class="w-3/4 mx-auto mt-8 text-lg lg:text-xl">
		If so, you're not alone. Many homes throughout Northwest Florida, including Panama City Beach,
		Destin, Santa Rosa Beach and 30-A area are built on sandy soil, which can make them susceptible
		to foundation problems such as cracks, bowing walls, and water damage. If you're noticing any of
		these signs, it's important to have a foundation repair expert inspect your home as soon as
		possible

		more..
